• Distinguish between reinforcement schedules
The previous section of this chapter focused on the type of associative learning known as classical
conditioning. Remember that in classical conditioning, something in the environment triggers a reflex
automatically, and researchers train the organism to react to a different stimulus. Now we turn to the second
type of associative learning, operant conditioning. In operant conditioning, organisms learn to associate a
behavior and its consequence (Table 6.1). A pleasant consequence makes that behavior more likely to be
repeated in the future. For example, Spirit, a dolphin at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, does a flip in the

Social psychology is the subfield of psychology that studies the power of the situation to influence individuals’
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Psychologists categorize the causes of human behavior as those due to
internal factors, such as personality, or those due to external factors, such as cultural and other social
influences. Behavior is better explained, however, by using both approaches. Lay people tend to over-rely on
dispositional explanations for behavior and ignore the power of situational influences, a perspective called the
fundamental attribution error. People from individualistic cultures are more likely to display this bias versus

Now that you know how classical conditioning works and have seen several examples, let’s take a look at some
of the general processes involved. In classical conditioning, the initial period of learning is known as
acquisition, when an organism learns to connect a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus. During

Sensation
What does it mean to sense something? Sensory receptors are specialized neurons that respond to specific
types of stimuli. When sensory information is detected by a sensory receptor, sensation has occurred. For
example, light that enters the eye causes chemical changes in cells that line the back of the eye. These cells
relay messages, in the form of action potentials (as you learned when studying biopsychology), to the central
nervous system. The conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as transduction.

broad terms about the kinds of functions associated with different neurotransmitters (Table 3.1). Much of what
psychologists know about the functions of neurotransmitters comes from research on the effects of drugs in
psychological disorders. Psychologists who take a biological perspective and focus on the physiological

imbalances in one or more neurotransmitter systems. In this perspective, psychotropic medications can help

• Describe what is meant by harmful dysfunction
• Identify the formal criteria that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors must meet to be considered abnormal and,
thus, symptomatic of a psychological disorder
According to the American Psychiatric Association, a psychological disorder, or mental disorder, is “a
syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation,
or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying
mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with significant distress in social, occupational, or

Behaviorism’s emphasis on objectivity and focus on external behavior had pulled psychologists’ attention away
from the mind for a prolonged period of time. The early work of the humanistic psychologists redirected
attention to the individual human as a whole, and as a conscious and self-aware being. By the 1950s, new
disciplinary perspectives in linguistics, neuroscience, and computer science were emerging, and these areas
revived interest in the mind as a focus of scientific inquiry. This particular perspective has come to be known
as the cognitive revolution (Miller, 2003). By 1967, Ulric Neisser published the first textbook entitled Cognitive
Psychology, which served as a core text in cognitive psychology courses around the country (Thorne & Henley,

Successful replications bolster confidence in the original research, making scientists more likely to accept the conclusions.  Conversely, repeated failures to replicate a study raise serious questions about the original study's methodology, potential biases, or even the legitimacy of its conclusions.  This is particularly important in psychology, where a 'replication crisis' has highlighted the need for rigorous replication efforts. The inability to reproduce results undermines the credibility of a study and the broader field, potentially leading to the rejection of findings or a re-evaluation of the theoretical frameworks upon which the research was based.  Replication, therefore, is not simply a repeat, but a process of strengthening or weakening a study's claims through additional evidence, ultimately contributing to a more robust and reliable body of psychological knowledge.","{""sections"": [""psychological_research/analyzing_findings""], ""pages"": [""57""]}"

Research into the effects of drugs on these disorders has significantly increased our understanding of neurotransmitter functions. Psychotropic medications, designed to treat these disorders, work by influencing neurotransmitter levels, either increasing or decreasing their activity.

They act as unwritten rules, guiding individuals on how to act in various situations, ranging from everyday interactions to emergency responses.  These norms, which are often learned through cultural transmission and socialization, shape our actions by creating a sense of what is appropriate, acceptable, or expected.  Deviation from established norms can often lead to social sanctions or disapproval, reinforcing their power in directing behavior.  Ultimately, social norms provide a structure for social interaction and predictability, influencing whether someone might help a stranger or how one might behave in an unfamiliar environment.

It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this
time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,
at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological
organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,
psychology is also a social science.
WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?
Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to
learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course
because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as
nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare","The provided text focuses on the history and reasons for studying psychology, not its applications in education.

It's the active process of applying skills to understand and evaluate information, a crucial skill given the abundance of competing and potentially misleading information. In psychology, this means students learn to be skeptical, identify their own biases, utilize logic, ask insightful questions, and make careful observations.  This skillset is essential for evaluating psychological research, interpreting data, and forming well-reasoned conclusions.  Psychology students' training in critical thinking equips them to navigate complex information and make informed judgments, fostering a deeper understanding of human behavior and mental processes.","{""sections"": [""introduction_to_psychology/history_of_psychology""], ""pages"": [""9""]}"
